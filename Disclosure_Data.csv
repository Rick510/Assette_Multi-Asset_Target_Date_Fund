Plain talk about risk
Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying Vanguard funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks
associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying Vanguard funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. As the
underlying funds invest in stocks and bonds the fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the
fund’s current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the fund’s overall level of risk should be higher than those funds that invest the majority of their
assets in bonds, but lower than those investing entirely in stocks. As the fund’s allocation among underlying funds gradually changes, the fund’s overall level of risk also will decline. The
fund also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the fund to underperform other funds
with a similar investment objective. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year 2070 when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will
gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in the Target Retirement 2070 Fund is not
guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date. For further details on all risks, please refer to the fund’s prospectus.
